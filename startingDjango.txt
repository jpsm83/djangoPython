"pip" is the standard package manager for Python. It enables the installation and management of third party packages that provide
install python

it a good practice to install and develp a project in a separate inviorament
cdm as administrator
pip install virtualenv

command for virtualenv
create a new enviorament command with whatever name you want (usualy "env")
virtualenv <virtual machine name>
virtualenv env
this will create a new folder for the VM

get in the new VM folder and activate the enviorament just created
env\scripts\activate

desactivate the enviorament just created
env\scripts\deactivate

install django in the project folder
pip install django
this create a project djanto in a virtual enviorament

check if django been install properly
py -m django --version
that should return django version

django-admin
shows you all the command lines for django

django-admin startproject <project name>
this command will start a django new project
add " ." at the end to create the project at the same directory
not creating a new directory and them a project inside it
django-admin startproject <project name> .

now you need create an "app" to work with on this project
python manage.py startapp <app name, usualy is "base">
add the app to be seen at settings

python manage.py
show all the command lines for phyton
those commands are the same as django ones
but we use python to run services for example
because django doesnt know the settings of the project
python knows

python manage.py runservice <port number>
port number is opcional, by default will be created at 8000
server will be start

done, project is create and running in the server

pipenv --venv
change the python path on visual studio to be running properly
will show the path that python uses to run the aplication
ex: \Users\integral\.virtualenvs\djangoBack-2Nl-N0vO
add "\bin\python" to complete the direction
\Users\integral\.virtualenvs\djangoBack-2Nl-N0vO\bin\python

python manage.py startapp <app name>
create a new app to use in the project

create a admin user to access the aplicacion
python manage.py createsuperuser
fill the form
now you can access your localhost/admin

django-rest-framework.org
framework to work with apis in django
pip install djangorestframework

setup cors
python -m pip install django-cors-headers
-m stants for "module"
you need to config cors to accept 3tr part requests
